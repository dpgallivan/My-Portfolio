			  <h1>About Me</h1>
			    <p>Greetings! My name is Daniel Gallivan and I have been interested in the gaming industry ever since I started playing the Nintendo 64. From there on, I have been playing all my life. 
				I went to study at the University of California, Merced with a background in sociology and management. 
				While there I was too scared to go into computer science and even try to work in the field as my family was not as supportive of the idea. 
				Now, I am taking a program at UCLA for web development to either pursue a career in front-end, QA test engineer, or software engineer. 
				I am looking for opportunities to go into the gaming industry one step at a time. 
				The websites that this industry comes up with are incredibly interactive and beautifully displayed for us gamers to navigate through and learn all we need to. From understanding the stories of the games, how to play, forums to interact with the community and employees of the company, and having fun interacting with website. 
				If not creating a website, then I would love to test them. I have very good analytic skills from my education and studying abroad so I am able to examine code and see what the problem(s) originate from. This also allows testing the games themselves, which I plenty of experience in many different genres of play so my critique and analysis could come a long way. 
				My main goal is to be in charge as a director one day in the industry and I am able to commit to my dream without worrying about anyone and fear of failing. 
				Any advice to this junior dev would be most welcome and greatly appreciated.
